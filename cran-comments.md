NOTE:

  New submission

This is in order.



2) Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:

    Bijlsma (12:555)  
    Counterfactual (3:25)  
    Sudharsanan (12:541)  
    analytical (12:311)  
    multivariable (12:238)  

Bijlsma and Sudharsanan are the authors names
Counterfactual and analytical are correctly written, as is multivariable. The latter is expressly NOT the same as 'multivariate'


Many thanks
