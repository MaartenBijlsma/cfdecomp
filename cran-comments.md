This is a first release of the cfdecomp package, which has so far only been available on github under the name cfdecomp

Note that examples are encased in 'dontrun' because the examples take a long time to run, but these have been tested and they work.

## Test environments

* local test on Windows NT 6.1 (64-bit), R version 3.6.2 (2019-12-12)
* Via win-builder on x86_64-w64-mingw32 (64-bit)
  * R Under development (unstable) (2020-01-28 r77738)
* via devtools::rhub()
	* Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1, R-devel, 32/64 bit
	* Ubuntu Linux 16.04 LTS, R-release, GCC
	* Fedora Linux, R-devel, clang, gfortran
* via R travis-ci Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS
	* R version 3.6.2 (2017-01-27)

NOTE: 
1) Maintainer: Maarten Bijlsma <maarten.bijlsma@gmail.com>
  
  New submission

This is in order.



2) Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:

    Bijlsma (12:555)  
    Counterfactual (3:25)  
    Sudharsanan (12:541)  
    analytical (12:311)  
    multivariable (12:238)  

Bijlsma and Sudharsanan are the authors names
Counterfactual and analytical are correctly written, as is multivariable. The latter is expressly NOT the same as 'multivariate'


Many thanks
